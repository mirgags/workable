My level of interest in joining the Leap Wireless\\u2019s team is extremely high, and I believe my experience to date will showcase why this will be a mutually beneficial partnership moving forward.\\r\\nMy experience in managing large digital projects and web activations will lead to a perfect fit for both PINT and myself in establishing a long-term working relationship together. I have been able to grow and expand my knowledge in the fields of digital marketing strategy, digital analytics, KPI defining and measuring, as well as overall business and brand management.  Having spent the majority of my career working with and representing the large international consumer electronics company LG as well as the consumer goods company The UPS Store, I have been conditioned to meet rigorous executive requests and full ownership of the projects I engage in. For example, I played a pivotal role in the transition of LG.com through three different life stages (both creative redesigns and backend platform migrations) which resulted in year over year increases in overall website visitors, click to sale conversions, and increased brand awareness. The practice of creating and continual adaptation and transformation of online marketing campaigns is the most exciting element of my profession.\\r\\nThe importance of being able to \\u201clive the brand\\u201d online is a critical skill needed in today\\u2019s business environment. Through my experience of creating detailed user scenarios / persona matrices and communication plans for online digital activations, I feel as if I could spearhead the planning and development for Leap Wireless\\u2019s growing client base. My formal training in the use of Omniture, Google Analytics, and Google Webmaster Tools; I possess the skills and knowledge needed to be able to make critical adjustments and explain the reasoning behind the decisions to top management within the client\\u2019s space. One working example of this resulted in a major business shift in the digital marketing efforts and allocation of budgetary dollars for the LG Mobile Team. Based on monthly analytics reports and presentations, we found that our traditional microsite experience was not performing at a level we would expect for the amount of dollars that were being allocated\\u2026 resulting in poor ROI and a decline in consumer engagement and sales. We revised the strategy and decided to spend the development efforts on creating more integrated promotional pieces hosted on the larger LG.com platform and remove the stand alone microsite from the marketing mix. The result were web engagements that significantly reduced production time and cost; while boosting overall site visitors, engagement, SEO, and direct to purchase conversions.     \\r\\nI thrive in a rigorous work environment while being surrounded by jovial like-minded individuals. As I have been traveling quite extensively for work over the past two years, I am very excited in exploring the next steps in the interview process and getting to know more about the PINT\\u2019s business goals as well as their current staff over the next few weeks.

After much personal research I have come to appreciate the prestige and culture at PINT. I have a strong background in business marketing and outside sales. I have a passion for sales and believe I have a talent for the industry. I admire PINT\\u2019s wide variety of web based products provided for their clients, and the active role PINT is having on simplifying web analytics and web marketing for its small business customers. I am certain that a position working as a Sales Representative would afford me a platform to excel and demonstrate my skills, but also learn at a fast and exciting pace. \\r\\nI recently graduated from Cal State University San Marcos in the fall of 2012. Being a full time student for the past 5 years and working full-time, has allowed me to establish excelling time management capabilities. Through 2008 to 2010 I was the Assistant Director for OC Riptides, a very prestigious volleyball club located in Orange County and Oceanside. My duties through these years were to head all marketing and business development of the club within North County San Diego. I had to meet with countless clients and schools to establish professional relationships and client rapport for the business. Within two years I assisted in bringing in over 150 clients and helped manage 6 teams throughout the club season and Junior Olympics. After graduating from college I immediately tested to receive my Personal lines broker and Life Only Broker license for insurance in California. Within my first 3 months I was able to effectively sign 30 clients and over 50,000 in premium. I have worked as an Insurance broker for 7 months now, and can use this experience as proof of success in a hard selling environment. Throughout this experience I gained valuable knowledge on the skills and requirements needed to effectively communicate and represent a business to its targeted customers in a positive and productive way. Using my skills in writing and verbal communication I learned the necessary steps to attract targeted audiences toward future relationships with the business. \\r\\nFrom all these experiences, I bring with me the ability to write and otherwise communicate effectively between parties to present my work and myself in a professional manner, think analytically and creatively, set and achieve goals, and be proactive in achieving deadlines in a team environment. I am extremely motivated to make the most of any opportunity I have to pursue my career, and I know PINT will be an excellent company to learn from. My previous experiences attest to my ability at organization, market analysis, and sales production, ensuring that I can succeed at PINT and contribute positively for the company. I am confident that given the opportunity I will exceed your expectations and goals set for me. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Through my efforts, I have increased the sales in every position I have had and left my positions with an increased database of new and prospective clients. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has taken me some time to figure out which direction I want my career to go; however, through hard work and dedication to each of the jobs that I have held, I have been able to pin point my common strengths and weaknesses; allowing me to determine what I really want to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would really like to be a part of your marketing team at Pint.

While at LEVICK, I kept my team and my client up to date with weekly progress reports including analytics and recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also regularly updated our website with new content, imagery and SEO recommendations from our vendor, tracked and reported on the firm\\u2019s business development efforts and managed our CRM system and email campaigns on a daily basis. I helped with presentation collateral, was the main point of contact for all third party marketing vendors, designed and stocked LEVICK branded items and planned, budgeted and executed monthly networking and internal events.

I am applying for the Marketing Associate position with PINT. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a growing specialist in marketing strategy and communications, I have helped grow the capacity of companies in both San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area. My most recent position was as a Marketing and Community Outreach Intern with Elmwood Caf\\u00e9, a charity caf\\u00e9 located in Berkeley, CA. I completely redesigned and launched their website, while working to also increase their communications with potential charity partners through event planning and social media campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am also a marketing strategy innovator. As a Promoter for XL Recordings in Berkeley, CA, I was awarded a financial bonus for creating a partnership with Amoeba Records that increased visibility of XL Recordings\\u2019 products during Record Store Day 2011. I am devoted to working for nonprofit causes, and as an Events Promotion and Outreach Intern for Sundt Memorial Foundation in La Jolla, CA, I created a marketing plan for the Foundation\\u2019s efforts at the Warped Tour Music Festival that helped spread the Foundation\\u2019s message to 3,000 new young adults, and increased the Foundation\\u2019s newsletter database by 1,500 new subscribers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduating from the University of California, Berkeley I started my own media production company, called Subvert Media. In the first year, Subvert partnered with Consequence of Sound (CoS) and Subculture to help promote the Block x Blog Music Festival. In addition to producing all of the video and photography surrounding the event and publishing it via Vimeo, social media, and the CoS and Subculture websites, I helped with the festival planning and administration. As a result, Block x Blog was voted as this year\\u2019s \\u201cBest Local Music Festival\\u201d by the New Times Broward-Palm Beach Weekly. I have continued my career in media as the current Video Production Intern for Project Concern International (PCI), a local development agency that works in 15 countries around the world.

Delving into market and consumer research requires a unique blend of expertise in conceptualizing statistics, analyzing market trends, identifying opportunities and leading a team to provide valuable, measurable results to the company\\u2019s bottom line. I believe that my education and skill set are an excellent match.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my current position as a Surveillance Operator, my primary goal is to observe and report. It is my duty to protect the casino\\u2019s assets and gaming integrity. As a Surveillance Operator, we are held at high standards and expectations. We must have the ability to work well under pressure and possess strong analytical skills. During my time in the Surveillance Department, I have refined these skills, which are pertinent for a career in Marketing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough my intensive studies, I have gained a competitive advantage over other candidates. Juniata College offers a unique approach in education. A student may choose or create a Program of Emphasis (POE) which allows you to design any program of study that suits your interests. From Marketing Management to Women Work & Identity, I was able to explore courses that challenged me intellectually. For example, Digital Media & Design allowed me to discover my creativity through numerous projects that required me to market myself. Because of this, I have proficient skills in programs like Adobe InDesign and Illustrator. Mass Media & Society was a course focused on the examination of the convergence of mass media. Completing this course ensued a better understanding of media as business versus its social responsibility to its citizens. By creating a POE in Business Communication, I was able to fuel my intellectual passions and develop unique skills that set me apart from other candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that my experience, age, and interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for this position. I am detail oriented, a diligent worker, and passionate about my work. I will be a valuable asset to your company and I will use this as an opportunity to help improve the Marketing Department at PINT. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this position and how I can make a positive contribution to your organization\\u2019s goals.

I am applying for the position of Junior PHP Developer. I consider myself suitable for this position as the desired skill set required for this job matches with my education and interest. I have detailed my background information below.\\r\\nI graduated from my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Mumbai, India. It was a three year course and after that I took a transfer to California state university, Fresno for final year on Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. For my senior project I decided to implement my web programming knowledge and make a project which I am also presently working on. The project is Soccer Stats and Updates. The website will be live within seven day\\u2019s time and the link for the same would be www.soccerStatsAndUpdates.com\\r\\nFeatures of my application:-\\r\\n\\u2022\\tProvides latest updates to the fans.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tInteresting statistics which are not readily available even on the most famous websites.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tStatistics displayed in graphical manner. Since a graph speaks a million words and is much preferred over tabular data.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tSends email and SMS alerts of the events happening in the ongoing match to the users who registered for it (SMTP emails).\\r\\n\\u2022\\tNews linked to the various facebook\\u2019s fan page. Makes it easier for the fans to find everything under one roof.\\r\\nIn order to make the website look attractive and dynamic I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX. Made efficient use of JavaScript to validate forms. jQuery and AJAX  made the page dynamic and helped save page reloading time, also made it look better. Used PHP to retrieve the data from the database, process and make interesting analysis.  My application also required me to have a good deal of knowledge of database. I used the concept of MySQL triggers, stored procedures and indexes to good effect to make it efficient. \\r\\n\\tMy determination to be a part of the PHP web programming industry is evident from the fact that I continue to educate myself further and make myself more efficient. These days I am learning Yii framework and getting a good grip on it.\\r\\n\\tI understand that I lack experience, but with me I bring to your company a young prospect with a passion towards web programming. I also encourage myself and people around me to be creative which talks about my team player skills. And I am also a quick learner. I can back that statement because as a part of my project, I had to learn 3 separate languages in a short-span and apply them in the context of my application.\\r\\n\\tI think I qualify the requirements and that I can be an invaluable asset to your firm.

I met so many different people, learned about different cultures and got to see some of the most beautiful places. After doing so, I moved back home with my mom to save some money and look for a job within my field of study. Although, I did find employment, there was no room for growth and nothing keeping me happy there because I knew there was more of the world for me to see.

With many years of customer service and management experience, I believe I could be an asset to this position and establishment.  The bulk of my experience is in the retail and e-commerce industries, but I constantly have the desire to change and develop new skills.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous position I held was that of store manager for Spirit Halloween.  I was responsible for all aspects of the store including set-up and teardown, a crew of 20 employees, and the analyzing of daily, weekly and monthly sales reports.  One of the most important and challenging facets of this position was hiring a team that fit my management style.  Looking back, I do feel that I selected a well-suited group of people for this temporary arrangement. The management position required an immense amount of multi-tasking, attention to detail and flexibility.  To be as successful as I was in this position, I often had to use the critical and analytical thinking, and communication skills I acquired while earning my Bachelor of Art\\u2019s degree in psychology from the University of Rhode Island.  While studying at URI, I also had the amazing opportunity to be a member, and captain, of the women\\u2019s volleyball team, which is how I perfected time-management skills.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout my professional career I have developed strong inter-personal skills and also the ability to relate to people on all levels.  The current position I hold is Customer Service Supervisor for VetDepot.com, where reading people and problem solving are constants.  I am very friendly and hold a professional demeanor as well. I enjoy working as part of a team to reach a common goal, but I am also motivated for independent tasks.  Ensuing the day-to-day tasks in the office run smooth is a top priority in this current position. I am a hard-working and dedicated individual and am always willing to learn new ways to better not only myself, but also the company I represent.  I am very energetic and love to bring a positive outlook to every day.  These personality traits of mine are big reasons as to why I have had the opportunity and privilege to gain such a solid background of customer service experience.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point in my career and life I am looking for a position that I love but will also be challenging.  The Administrative Assistant position will not only allow me to be a part of an incredible industry, but it would give me a chance to be a part of a new team working towards a common goal. With this letter and my resume, I have listed many of the responsibilities I have held at various positions.  I feel that I have been able to handle these tasks proficiently and with a passion to succeed.

As I transition from the armed forces, I will continue to offer the best. Here\'s what I can bring to PINT: An energetic will to learn coupled with the ability to produce results as a team player. I want to bring my administrative experience to a professional team that utilizes communication, teamwork, and integrity to get the job done right the first time. I pride myself on honesty and the fact that I am a very reliable person. I will try my best every time at completing goals, and I am humble enough to ask for help when I do not have the answer or when guidance is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost recently, while working in San Diego for Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron One I was the Personnel Officer and Command Career Counselor in charge of billet acquisition and Sailor distribution during a massive reorganization of the force. Designated to sign \\"By direction\\" for the Commanding Officer, I created and distributed correspondence in the daily administrative functions of the command. During this chaotic period I was also responsible for the stability of each Sailor\'s career by assessing performance and providing guidance in career and personal decisions. I was also the commands travel coordinator, ensuring that our budget was not breached while maintaining mission readiness. During my tenure I completed a deployment to the Middle East ensuring that over 500 Sailors were paid accurately and timely. No other Personnel Officer in the combat theater had accomplished the task of paying specialty pays and per diem requests as fast as I did. This ensured that my Sailor\\u2019s morale was at its best possible, and their mind was on the mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I separated from the U.S. Navy in September, 2012 I completed my bachelors degree at FHSU.  Immediately thereafter I continued toward my goal of achieving a MBA.  I am currently 1/3 of the way complete and on schedule to graduate with honors with a current 4.0 GPA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skills I\'ve acquired and valuable experiences I\'ve gained during my time in the military coupled with my studies this past year at graduate school makes me a perfect fit for the PINT Administrative Assistant position. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be an honor to join your team.

CTI is a small business that manufactures engineered structures and tents that are shipped worldwide.  I was the Administrative Assistant for the President, Carol Fontius, at the corporate headquarters located in Weed, Ca. I currently work as the Sales/Marketing Coordinator at IMS which is a research firm that specializing in tracking public-sector work for architects, engineers, and construction companies. Working for both these firms have increased my knowledge, skills, and has taught me outstanding work ethics. I have attached my Resume to summarize my qualifications for this position.\\r\\nAs the Administrative Assistant for Carol Fontius, I was responsible for booking and managing the marketing, advertising, and trade show departments for CTI. All three of these departments have forced me to work under pressure, stay well organized, and work with little to no supervision. I prepared shipments, organize travel, and put together hundreds of brochures for worldwide trade shows. My duties after a trade show were to evaluate the trade show\\u2019s effectiveness, audit expenses, and critique my coordination. I would also work alongside the owners of CTI to help prepare government solicitations and proof read legal documents. In addition, I would complete any side tasks Carol needed assistance with. For example, I would maintain the daily flow of Carol\\u2019s desk to help her stay well organized and less overwhelmed. I was extremely involved in the Bookkeeping department. I worked alongside the bookkeeper and the corporate accountant to help with any tax information, A/R A/P filing, invoicing, and credit card reconciling, and any miscellaneous tasks. \\r\\nMy current experience as the Sales/Marketing Coordinator for IMS I am responsible for pre-qualifying potential clients, placing firms on free-trials, following up accordingly, closing sales, and initiate the billing process. I currently close the most sales in the Sales Department at IMS. I network with clients and potential clients at monthly SMPS San Diego Chapter luncheons, happy hours, and golfing tournaments. I also coordinated all booth, sponsorship, and travel arrangements for the national SMPS Conference in Orlando, FL this year. I manage the Facebook and Twitter social platforms for IMS in addition to researching industry trends and keeping our followers up-to-date with our presence at conferences. Through IMS I\\u2019ve participated in beach cleanups, distributed sleeping bags to the homeless, and raised money for survival backpacks through a paddle boarding event. \\r\\nI am a very enthusiastic, cheerful, and an outgoing person. I always radiate positive energy to everyone around me and tend to make people smile. I am a quick learner, thorough communicator, and never hesitate to ask questions. One trait about myself that most people comment on is my ability to find solutions to any challenges I encounter. I face challenges head on with an open mind and constructive attitude. I enjoy keeping myself busy and applying my organizational skills to all projects. I have a talent in creative thinking and am always open minded toward arising opportunities. I am very dedicated, confident, and loyal toward my commitments in addition to applying my judgment in prioritizing projects.  \\r\\nMy ambition is to further my knowledge and contribute my skills to help the development of your company.

While there, I provided analytic details for all emails sent from Feb 2012 to Aug 2013. I also updated the 2012 website traffic report, which provides a comparison of the previous year in seven different categories per brand and created the 2013 version through Aug 2013. I was also in charge of the email productivity report that shows open rates and click through rates for all emails sent from Oct 2012 to Aug 2013. While at Stage Stores, I used my analytical skills to interpret results and provide recommendations based on the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to Stage Stores, I was a Project Manager with BMC Software within their Worldwide Marketing Team. On average I managed multiple creative projects (including email marketing campaigns, new concept ads, new concept booth graphics, etc.) working with multiple stakeholders both internal and external. When new projects came in, I would schedule resources, create timelines and organize kick off meetings which helped to establish clear expectations for all parties involved. By monitoring my projects on a daily basis, it allowed for open communications with the client and the designer. If there were any concerns, they could be addressed quickly.  As a Project Manager, you need to be very specific, organized, have the ability to multi-task and work with multiple stakeholders. I have all of these qualities which allow projects that I work on to stay on schedule and budget. The combination of my experience and skills plus the enjoyment I find from being a Project Manager is what I believe you are looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring my time at BMC Software, I was also a Direct Marketing Manager. In this role, I would manage email marketing campaigns for all Field Marketing Managers by acting as a liaison between clients (approximately 20 Field Marketing Managers worldwide) and the Creative Services team which allowed for streamlined production of campaigns. I acted as a mini-project manager in this role as I would create schedules, facilitate timelines, work with creative services and writing teams, providing metrics and archiving of emails that were delivered. During this time, BMC Software switched from an agency based email management system to Eloqua (an internal email management system). I was trained to create campaigns, emails and landing pages. By bringing this in house, email campaigns were completed faster and more efficient. The knowledge and skills learned in this role helped me to be a better Project Manager. Knowing what your clients really need is a huge asset.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to BMC Software I held Executive Assistant roles at The Houstonian Club and Hotel Derek.  Both of these roles required excellent communication skills, organization, team work, marketing, and logistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see from my resume, I am the perfect fit for your next Project Manager (organizational skills, muti-tasker, attention to details, interpersonal skills, ability to work on numerous projects, analytical, etc.). I understand this position is in the San Diego area so I am happy to relocate. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

My level of interest in joining the Leap Wireless\\u2019s team is extremely high, and I believe my experience to date will showcase why this will be a mutually beneficial partnership moving forward.\\r\\nMy experience in managing large digital projects and web activations will lead to a perfect fit for both PINT and myself in establishing a long-term working relationship together. I have been able to grow and expand my knowledge in the fields of digital marketing strategy, digital analytics, KPI defining and measuring, as well as overall business and brand management.  Having spent the majority of my career working with and representing the large international consumer electronics company LG as well as the consumer goods company The UPS Store, I have been conditioned to meet rigorous executive requests and full ownership of the projects I engage in. For example, I played a pivotal role in the transition of LG.com through three different life stages (both creative redesigns and backend platform migrations) which resulted in year over year increases in overall website visitors, click to sale conversions, and increased brand awareness. The practice of creating and continual adaptation and transformation of online marketing campaigns is the most exciting element of my profession.\\r\\nThe importance of being able to \\u201clive the brand\\u201d online is a critical skill needed in today\\u2019s business environment. Through my experience of creating detailed user scenarios / persona matrices and communication plans for online digital activations, I feel as if I could spearhead the planning and development for Leap Wireless\\u2019s growing client base. My formal training in the use of Omniture, Google Analytics, and Google Webmaster Tools; I possess the skills and knowledge needed to be able to make critical adjustments and explain the reasoning behind the decisions to top management within the client\\u2019s space. One working example of this resulted in a major business shift in the digital marketing efforts and allocation of budgetary dollars for the LG Mobile Team. Based on monthly analytics reports and presentations, we found that our traditional microsite experience was not performing at a level we would expect for the amount of dollars that were being allocated\\u2026 resulting in poor ROI and a decline in consumer engagement and sales. We revised the strategy and decided to spend the development efforts on creating more integrated promotional pieces hosted on the larger LG.com platform and remove the stand alone microsite from the marketing mix. The result were web engagements that significantly reduced production time and cost; while boosting overall site visitors, engagement, SEO, and direct to purchase conversions.     \\r\\nI thrive in a rigorous work environment while being surrounded by jovial like-minded individuals. As I have been traveling quite extensively for work over the past two years, I am very excited in exploring the next steps in the interview process and getting to know more about the PINT\\u2019s business goals as well as their current staff over the next few weeks. I look forward to walking and work down this path together. \\r\\nKindest Regards, Sean Conforto\\r\\n", "domain": "indeed.com", "experieneces": [{"end_date": "2007-08-01", "title": "Finance Internship", "industry": "Financial Services", "summary": "", "current": false, "start_date": "2007-05-01", "company": "Merrill Lynch"}, {"end_date": "2010-05-01", "title": "Digital Account Executive", "industry": "Marketing and Advertising", "summary": "The Digital Account Executive serves a critical role in being the liaison for the client and will manage project schedules and deliverables.

As my portfolio attests to, I can effectively create: Wireframes, interactive mockups, personas, affinity diagrams, style guides and storyboards to address user concerns at the early stages of a project.

My cognitive science background addresses how to properly observe user concerns through data and observation, as well as how to properly design with the user in mind. My visual arts background has shown me how to portray my creativity.  More specifically, it gave me the basis to learn the tools I needed - such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Fireworks and more-- which I consider myself proficient at.\\r\\n\\tOn a personal level, I would consider myself ambitious above all else.

I am a detail-oriented individual with a unique background. I studied and worked abroad for two years, which gave me a broad experience of exploration and reinforced my passion for working with people. My professionalism and cheerful demeanor will be an asset when supporting team members and following through with correspondence. During my internship at Open-City, an architecture and design advocacy nonprofit in London, I was responsible for contacting architects, the media, and teachers, and have excellent interpersonal communication skills. I researched national education standards for our projects, coordinated mailings and planned event expositions where I helped represent the organization. Additionally, I worked within their media database and expanded the list of warm contacts. It was rewarding to see the results of my efforts, and the opportunity to continue working in supportive tasks and clerical duties is an exciting prospect. My internship at Open-City helped me advance my administrative skill-set, which I have continued in my position with Ashford University.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Ashford University, I held the very rewarding position of Military Student Advisor. I worked with students to coordinate their schedules and advise them on their individual scholastic needs and supported them through providing financial and academic insight. I tracked student progression, including documentation in Excel and reports of their finances. I used the data to correct any financial shortfalls and prioritize time-sensitive tasks based on student need. The position necessitated analytical foresight with discretion over sensitive information and practice at fostering positive relationships in a business setting. Additionally, I have seven years of customer service experience, including five years as a shift supervisor with Starbucks Coffee.

I am a marketing graduate, who will be living in the San Diego area as of January. I am currently employed as a Marketing Administrative Assistant at a highly successful financial institution. Previous to this, I have worked as an Administrative Assistant for much of my career, while doing a lot of marketing and public relations along the way. I have worked as an assistant to individuals (including Senior Management) as well as teams. I believe I have the right qualifications and would be the perfect candidate for the PINT team. I am enthusiastic, detail oriented, and a hard worker. I also have the strength and ability to work on my own as a self-directed employee. I believe I would be a great asset to your team!\\r\\nI am extremely interested in this position. I believe I have what it takes to succeed in the Administrative Coordinator position. At my current job, which is at Bath Savings Institution (a well-known local bank in Maine), one of my main tasks is to be the initial point of communication for our customers and help direct them to where they need to be. A number of our customers are local non-profits and I have worked on promoting them around the area in various ways (i.e. Facebook, providing supplies for events, assisting with sponsorships, etc). I also take care of other various marketing and PR tasks on a daily basis which include communicating with vendors in a B2B sales scenario and editing/proofreading letters, brochures and pamphlets for various departments of the bank. I have continued to strengthen my Microsoft Office skills while at Bath Savings (including Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher and Access). And at TJ Maxx, as you will see in my resume, I was quickly promoted from a sales associate position to a Customer Service Coordinator position (also referred to as a Front End Coordinator). I also have great experience with scheduling and correspondence work.\\r\\nI hope you will consider me for this position as I would love to be part of your organization! I have a positive energy and a can-do outlook on life. I adapt well to any environment that I am put into and I am a quick learner. I have attached a resume.

I pride myself in being a quick learner and am proactive about self-informing when I am unfamiliar with a process or procedure.  My communication skills are well-developed, as are my writing and proofreading skills.  I have a Bachelor\\u2019s Degree in Linguistics from UCSD and over the past 10 years I have provided quality administrative support services to a variety of employers, from businesses with numerous employees, to working one-on-one with individual professionals.  I am comfortable working as an integral member of a team, as well as working independently with little to no supervision.  I view excellent communications as vital to an organization, both internally (co-workers, staff) and externally (clients and the public).  My writing, communication and interpersonal skills have been refined in response to numerous public inquiries or client/customer requests via email, phone, or on a walk-in basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have a strong work ethic, bring a great attitude to the workplace, work well with deadlines, and like to see an assignment through to completion.  I prefer not to sacrifice quality of work for quantity of work; although task completion and time effectiveness are important to me.  I maintain flexibility in order to better accommodate shifting priorities and timelines.  I am skilled at multitasking and will pitch in as circumstances may require, and with short notice.  My typing speed is 60 wpm, no errors, and I bring years of professional experience as well as sound judgment when working with sensitive material or acting as \\u2018gatekeeper\\u2019 to management.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI coordinated all special events hosted by the City of Solana Beach for several years.  These have included conferences, training workshops, and community-wide events ranging from 1 afternoon to several days in duration.  Coordinating these events started with the conceptual foundation or motivation for the event, through the tactical, financial and logistical production, and finally to composing the summary report that included a description of activities, impacts, public feedback, and \\u2018how to do it better next year\\u2019 suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope I have provided a brief overview of some of the skills and experience that I would bring to the Administrative Coordinator position.

I recently received my MBA and am looking to apply my strong project management skills and excellent communication abilities, all of which my former classmates and co-workers can vouch for. I have got good attention to detail, like task-oriented environments and strongly believe I would be an ideal fit for the Administrative Coordinator position at PINT. I\\u2019d love to be in a position that offers both short and long-term professional growth and potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have operations, event planning and administrative support experience through my previous job and the opportunities afforded through my graduate program have given me experience in managing tight deadlines and multiple projects. I spent three and a half years working in the lab of Professor Robert Sah in the UCSD Bioengineering Department. Despite my lack of a formal engineering foundation, I became an integral part of the lab operations, from helping write and coordinate grant proposals to supervising student workers to providing hands-on experimental support to the research staff to interfacing and serving as a point of contact with external parties in the fields of academia and research. I also handled logistics from coordinating calendars to booking travel to managing and purchasing lab inventory and reimbursement needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recently finished an accelerated MBA program at SDSU which provided further formal education and exposure to event planning and execution through volunteering. As a graduate student, I arranged team-building activities, volunteered and managed at 15-20 different events thru the year and did all this while completing 14 classes in 11 months, including foundational classes in finance, marketing, organizational behavior, accounting, etc. In addition to these and other consulting opportunities, internships, group assignments, papers and public-facing presentations, also proactively took charge of the program\\u2019s student blog, which our director saw as a key marketing tool. I managed and developed content through the Blogger platform, oversaw a team of seven, wrote nearly half of the 150+ posts throughout the year and edited and formatted all other contributions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the course of the program, I completed three consulting reports for various local companies and a twice-weekly internship at Upper Deck, the trading card company in Carlsbad. I then performed a full-time consulting project at a private golf course development as part of my final semester requirement. I completed all of the above while finishing with a 3.85 GPA, 2nd highest in the class of 32 and joined the Beta Gamma Sigma business honor society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I believe this arrangement would be a win-win and would appreciate a chance to convince you directly if you believe there is a possible fit. I am willing to work evening and weekends and do whatever is necessary to prove my value to the company. I hope to hear from you soon.
